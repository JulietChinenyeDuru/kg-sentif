**KG-SentIF** is an open-source implementation of a knowledge graph-enhanced
approach to Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). It combines transformer-based
NLP with graph-structured aspect relationships to produce sentiment intelligence
that is more interpretable and context-aware than flat sentiment classification.

This repository accompanies ongoing research on knowledge graph-enhanced
sentiment intelligence for mobile social media and product review analysis.

## What this framework does

Given raw review or social media text, KG-SentIF:

1. **Extracts aspects** — identifies the specific entities/features being
   discussed (e.g. "battery life", "camera quality", "customer service").
2. **Builds a knowledge graph** — links extracted aspects to a structured
   graph, capturing relationships between aspects, products, and categories.
3. **Classifies sentiment per aspect** — assigns polarity (positive / negative
   / neutral) to each aspect individually, rather than one score for the
   whole text.
4. **Produces an aspect-sentiment intelligence report** — a structured,
   queryable output combining (1)-(3), suitable for downstream analytics.

### Why knowledge graphs?

Flat sentiment analysis treats a review as one blob of text with one sentiment
score. This loses critical nuance — a review can praise the camera and
criticize the battery in the same sentence. By representing aspects and their
relationships as a graph, KG-SentIF:

- Preserves aspect-level nuance instead of collapsing it into an average
- Allows sentiment patterns to be queried and aggregated across a product line
- Enables reasoning over related aspects (e.g. "battery" ↔ "charging speed" ↔
  "power management")

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JulietChinenyeDuru/kg-sentif.git
cd kg-sentif
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Quick start

```python
from kg_sentif.pipeline import KGSentIFPipeline

pipeline = KGSentIFPipeline()

review = "The camera quality is excellent but the battery life is disappointing."
result = pipeline.analyze(review)

print(result)
```

Expected output (structure):

```python
{
    "text": "The camera quality is excellent but the battery life is disappointing.",
    "aspects": [
        {"aspect": "camera quality", "sentiment": "positive", "confidence": 0.91},
        {"aspect": "battery life", "sentiment": "negative", "confidence": 0.88}
    ],
    "graph_summary": {
        "nodes": 2,
        "edges": 1,
        "related_aspect_pairs": [("camera quality", "battery life")]
    }
}
```

## Running the demo

```bash
python examples/demo.py
```

This runs the pipeline over a small sample set of product reviews
(`examples/sample_reviews.json`) and prints the aspect-sentiment graph output
for each.

## Running tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```
